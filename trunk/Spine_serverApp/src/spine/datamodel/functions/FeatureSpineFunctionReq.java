/**
* 
* Objects of this class are used for expressing at high level function requests 
* (both activation and deactivation) of type 'Feature'.
* An application that needs to do a Feature request, must create a new FeatureSpineFunctionReq
* object, set on it the sensor involved and use the addFeature one or more times 
* (currently, up to 7 add are supported per each request) 
* for features activation, or the removeFeature (currently, up to 7 remove are supported per each request) 
* for features deactivation.
* 
* This class also implements the encode method of the abstract class SpineFunctionReq that is used internally
* to convert the high level request into an actual SPINE Ota message.
