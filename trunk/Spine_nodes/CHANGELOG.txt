What's new in SPINE 1.3:

- New open-source SPINE applications:

  ·     SPINE Nodes Emulator, to create multiple virtual SPINE-enabled sensor nodes;

  ·     Physical Energy Expenditure, measuring KCal burnt while performing daily physical activities; 

  ·     Data Collector Tool, to store data collected from sensor nodes into CSV or ARFF files;

  ·     GUI-based SPINE Test
 

- Optional Security Service (messages HW encryption) (contrib by Philip Kuryloski, while at Cornell University)

- New On-node Processing Functions:

  ·         Buffered Raw-Data, to transmit chunks of sensor readings in a single message

  ·         Step-Counter, a simplified accelerometer-based pedometer

  ·         HMM Classifier (contrib by Roozbeh Jafari's group, University of Texas at Dallas)


- New Features:
  
  ·     Entropy (contrib by Stefano Galzarano, Antonio Guerrieri, Università della Calabria)

  ·     KCal - physical energy expenditure (contrib by Edmund Seto, Po Yan, University of California at Berkeley)


- Moteiv optional sensor kit supported for Telosb/Tmote Sky Platform (contrib by Carlo Caione, Università di Bologna):

  ·     environmental temperature

  ·     humidity

  ·     PAR/TSR light

 
- CardioShield sensor-board, featuring a POLAR heart beat detector and a three-axis accelerometer (contrib by Alessandro Andreoli, Università Politecnica delle Marche, while at WSNLab Berkeley)

- SensorBoard defaulting according to target tinyos platform

- SPINE Manager and Listener Java APIs restyled (sw design contributed by Università degli Studi di Parma, Prof. Poggi, Prof. Turci)

- Compatibility break w.r.t. SPINE 1.2 (see par. 4.1 of the SPINE 1.3 Documentation for further details)

- Initial SPINE configuration strongly simplified through properties file

- SPINE Logger added, to enable/disable specific levels of logging
