/** 
 * Module to duty cycle the radio on and off, performing CCA receive checks.
 * When a carrier is sensed, this will leave the radio on. It is then up
 * to higher layers to turn the radio off again.  Once the radio is turned
 * off, this module will automatically continue duty cycling and looking for
 * a modulated signal.
 *
 * Suggested TODO's:
 *  > TransmitC and ReceiveC provide Energy, Byte, and Packet indicators.
 *    Tap into those to add more detection levels and granularity. Only let
 *    the radio turn off when we're not actively receiving bytes.  Right now
 *    the packet indicator is a little backwards.
 *  > Let one component be in charge of maintaining State information about
 *    the power of the radio, probably lower in the stack.
 *  > Wire SplitControl, Send, and Receive through this component.  Make it
 *    responsible for packet-level detections and being completely responsible
 *    for controlling the power of the radio without the use of upper layers
 *  > Remove unnecessary State components and Timers.
